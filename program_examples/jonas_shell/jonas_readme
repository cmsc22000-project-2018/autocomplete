to make the shell, run "make shell" from either the lsh or the src directory. Run the shell using ./shell

to use the shell, the following commands came with it from the original:
	1. cd: change the current directory
	2. ls: lists the files in the current directory
	3. help: lists the built-in commends

I invested the following commands:
	1. read <filename>
		enter in read followed by the name of a file in the current directory. It then prints the contents of the file. I borrowed a lot from one of my CS 152 homeworks for this. If you wanna try it out, try “read test.txt” or, for something spicier, “read bee_movie.txt”.
